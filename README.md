# Exploring Peaceful Cooperation: Quantifying the Impact of Economic Interdependence on Armed Conflict Probability
## A Comparative Study of Regional Trade Agreements and the Theory of Democratic Peace

Economic interdependence is a critical factor in shaping the probability of armed conflict.
This study aims to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between the depth of economic
interdependence in the form of regional trade agreements (RTAs) and peace. For this purpose, the
research adopts a quantitative research design, specifically logistic regression analysis on a dyadic
data structure. It finds that the existence of RTAs has a negative impact on the probability of
armed conflicts, although these findings can not be viewed as statistically significant.


# Conclusion

This expose presents a research proposal examining the relationship between economic
interdependence and the probability of armed conflict. The research question driving this investigation is: “To what extent does economic interdependence, as measured by regional trade agreements
(RTAs), influence the likelihood of armed conflict?” This paper hypothesized that RTAs will have
a negative impact on the probability of armed conflict between states. This work is not interested
in making completely accurate predictions. It is more concerned with analyzing larger trends.
The theoretical framework guiding this study is based on the theory of democratic peace, which
suggests that democratic systems and economic ties contribute to peaceful relations. Building on
Doyle (1986) hypothesized that higher levels of economic interdependence reflected through
RTAs will be associated with a lower probability of armed conflict.

Using regression analysis my findings seem to align with the hypothesis of RTAs being a negative
influence on countries going to war with each other. These findings however are not significant on
a 10% level, so they will have to be taken with caution. Other research like Powers (2004) should be consulted to make more substantial claims.
Moreover, there exist several other factors that require attention when analyzing foreign policy
and wars. Diplomatic actions and international pressure can lead many situations to be resolved
without escalation towards war. As this study aims to provide probabilities for certain decisions, it
may be beneficial to narrow down the variables and create a micro-economic game that considers
current and future economic developments when determining optimal decisions. Nonetheless, such
a task requires someone with greater knowledge of the topic than myself. To provide an accurate
assessment of the level of danger, individual developments need to be analyzed qualitatively. Using
the Goldstein score provided through world event data by Leetaru and Schrodt (2013) or McClelland
(1984) can operationalize individual developments into models that may be more precise than the
current one. However, this goes beyond the scope of this paper.
